     generate adb public/private key; private key stored in FILE,

scripting:
 wait-for[-TRANSPORT]-STATE...
     wait for device to be in a given state
     STATE: device, recovery, rescue, sideload, bootloader, or disconnect

      remount partitions read-write. if a reboot is required, -R will
      will automatically reboot the device.
 reboot [bootloader|recovery|sideload|sideload-auto-reboot]
     reboot the device; defaults to booting system image but
     supports bootloader and recovery too. sideload reboots
     into recovery and automatically starts sideload mode,
     sideload-auto-reboot is the same but reboots after sideloading.

internal debugging:
 start-server             ensure that there is a server running
 kill-server              kill the server if it is running

 reconnect device         kick connection from device side to force reconnect
 reconnect offline        reset offline/unauthorized devices to force reconnect
